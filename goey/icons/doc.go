// Package icons provides a widget that displays a single icon from the
// Material Design Icons set.  The size of the icon is fixed at 32x32 pixels.
//
// To display an icon, the code-point needs to be determined.  This information
// is available, but buried.  The icon names and glyphs can be viewed at
// the material icons library site (https://www.google.com/design/icons/).  To
// find the code-point, there is an index in the git repository
// (https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/iconfont/codepoints).

// License:  The original icon files are distributed under the Apache License
// 2.0.
